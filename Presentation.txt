Project Context :

Project Motivation :
* One of the main points of this project is to enable its users to accomplish simple tasks on their computer without having to interact with the keyboard or the mouse. It makes it possible to use it while your hands are dirty, when you are far from the computer, or for people who struggle to use the mouse and keyboard because of various reasons.
* Who hasn’t needed to pause a video or skip a song, but was too far from the computer, busy doing something else? Well, that’s exactly the problem our project Frogmote aims to solve.
* It only requires some memorization to use, and the user only needs to remember the gestures they want to use to remotely control their computer.
* Another strong point is to have one common piece of software that can be used to emulate an amount of gadgets like a pointer for slides or a remote.

Project Concept:
The project is a desktop application (available on Windows, macOS, and Linux) that allows communication with a smartphone acting as a remote control. The phone uses the Sensor Server app to transmit sensor data over Wi-Fi via a WebSocket connection. This sensor data is used to detect gestures on the desktop app, which are then mapped to actions on the computer, such as play, pause, fast forward, or next track. For now, detection is limited to the gyroscope, and four different gestures can be recognized.

The Design Process :
* We tried to think about the archetypes we were targeting, and it ended up being people who are slightly older and maybe don't have a lot of experience with computers. So, we decided to make a friendly interface with as little clutter as possible and little room for errors. We also opted for a friendly color theme but we kept in mind accessibility by keeping strong value contrast.
* With our target audience in mind, we also decided that the application should feel responsive. That being said, it should not be overwhelming so the animations are kept to their minimum.
- We chose a clean design with few elements. The clean, visually organized interface ensures users immediately understand the layout and interaction flow without prior instruction.
- We chose to add input constraints. The URL input only accepts valid WebSocket addresses preventing user errors and guiding them from the start.
- Lightweight app with a simple setup process ensures users can begin using it within seconds. No technical steps required.
- The app is also responsive with notifications, and a few UI animations.

- present the prototype (with a short demo)
-> show that the websocket input is restricted
-> talk about the notification
-> go to YouTube and use the forward / pause / mute actions
-> add a new card
-> change preset

- don't forget:
    - to speak about the evaluation 
    - to share time between all project's participants and to explain the role of each of them
    - to upload the TP and the project deliverables
